The robot must be compact, lightweight, robust, rigid, and waterproof for better performance.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>There may be various types of obstacles with different dimensions present on the racing track so, it is recommended to make the robot in such a way that it can pass all the obstacles to reach the final destination. The final race will be on the road so make your robot faster.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The maximum dimension of the robot can be 30cm X 30cm X 25cm.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The maximum voltage rating of the battery should be 12V.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The robot must be controlled wirelessly i.e. radio control \/ Bluetooth.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The robot must be well protected and wires are recommended to be hidden inside the chassis to make it waterproof\/dustproof.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>No weapons are allowed to be attached to the robot.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The robot must pass the technical inspections before the match starts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The track will be provided with a pit stop that will allow the team to make necessary changes to the robot. The permissible time period to be in the pit stop is 60 seconds. Any extra second will be added to the elapsed time.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Batteries, faring, and tires can be replaced at the pit stop along with the fastening of nut bolts.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The operator is not allowed to skip the obstacle, the robot must clear the obstacle sequentially that is present in its path.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>A team can have a maximum of 4 members.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Decisions of judges and event organizers shall be treated as final and binding on all and cannot be contested. The referee takes all the decisions and participants must abide by them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The organizers can change the rules of the game depending on the situation.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>The organizers can change the rules of the game depending on the situation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Event Description Roborace is a competition between wireless-controlled robots competing through rough terrain races, and on-track races.
